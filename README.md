# My music player

This project is a music player created on NextJS AppRouter, it uses Spotify Web API to fetch and play songs (require premium spotify account). 

## TODO

- [ ] Create a custom hook or context to enable Spotify API player anywhere easily (e.g useSession from NextAuth)
- [ ] Create components to improve readability on SideMenu, Carousel
- [ ] Change Carousel to SlideArea, is better than buttons (so old school)
- [ ] Add a search component
- [ ] Maybe a command component (just because its cool)
- [ ] Make easier to Login with spotify (to enable player)
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Deploy on Vercel!
